    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Akara, also known as bean cake, is a popular West African fritter made from black-eyed peas. It is a popular
        breakfast dish in Nigeria and other West African countries, but can also be enjoyed as a snack or appetizer at
        any time of day.

        Akara is made by blending black-eyed peas with onions, peppers, and spices until smooth. The batter is then
        deep-fried until golden brown and crispy on the outside and fluffy and soft on the inside. Akara is typically
        served with a variety of dipping sauces, such as pepper sauce, ketchup, or mustard.

        Akara is a good source of protein and fiber, and is also low in fat and calories. It is a popular dish among
        vegetarians and vegans, and is also a good option for people with dietary restrictions.</p>
