    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Nigerian fried rice is a one-pot dish made with rice, vegetables, and spices. It is a popular dish in Nigeria and
        throughout the African diaspora. It is often served as a main course or side dish, and can be accompanied by a
        variety of other Nigerian dishes, such as stews, soups, and grilled meats.

        Nigerian fried rice is typically made with parboiled rice, which is a type of rice that has been partially
        cooked before being milled. This gives the rice a firmer texture and prevents it from becoming mushy when
        cooked. The rice is first cooked in a pot with water or stock. Once the rice is cooked, it is mixed with
        vegetables and spices, such as curry powder, thyme, and salt. Other spices, such as black pepper, paprika, and
        dried bay leaves, are also sometimes used.

        A variety of vegetables can be used in Nigerian fried rice, such as carrots, green beans, peas, bell peppers,
        and sweet corn. The vegetables are typically chopped and stir-fried in oil before being added to the rice.
        Protein sources, such as chicken, beef, shrimp, or fish, can also be added to Nigerian fried rice, but this is
        optional.

        Once the vegetables and protein (if using) have been added to the rice, the dish is stir-fried until the rice is
        heated through and the vegetables are tender. Nigerian fried rice is typically served hot with a variety of
        dipping sauces, such as pepper sauce, ketchup, or mustard.

        Nigerian fried rice is a delicious and versatile dish that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. It is also a
        relatively easy dish to make, making it a great option for weeknight meals.</p>
