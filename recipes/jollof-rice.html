    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Jollof, or jollof rice, is a rice dish from West Africa. The dish is typically made with long-grain rice,
        tomatoes, chilies, onions, spices, and sometimes other vegetables and/or meat in a single pot, although its
        ingredients and preparation methods vary across different regions. The dish's origins trace to the Senegambian
        region.
        Regional variations are a source of competition between the countries of West Africa, and in particular Nigeria
        and Ghana, over whose version is the best; in the 2010s this developed into a friendly rivalry known as the
        "Jollof Wars". In French-speaking West Africa, a variation of the dish is known as riz au gras.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>The ingredients for making Jollof rice vary depending on the region and cook, but the following are the most
        common:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Rice:</em> Parboiled rice is the most common type of rice used for Jollof rice. It is a long-grain rice
            that has been
            partially cooked before being milled. This gives it a firmer texture and prevents it from becoming mushy
            when
            cooked.</li>
        <li><em>Tomatoes:</em> Ripe, red tomatoes are essential for Jollof rice. They can be fresh, canned, or pur√©ed.
        </li>
        <li><em>Tomato paste:</em> Tomato paste adds a rich, concentrated tomato flavor to Jollof rice.</li>
        <li><em>Onions:</em> Onions add sweetness and depth of flavor to Jollof rice.</li>
        <li><em>Red bell peppers:</em> Red bell peppers add sweetness, color, and a mild heat to Jollof rice.</li>
        <li><em>Scotch bonnet peppers:</em> Scotch bonnet peppers are a type of chili pepper that is very hot. They are
            often used
            sparingly in Jollof rice to add a bit of heat.</li>
        <li><em>Oil:</em> Vegetable oil is the most common type of oil used for Jollof rice.</li>
        <li><em>Spices:</em> Curry powder, thyme, and salt are the most common spices used for Jollof rice. Other
            spices, such as
            black pepper, paprika, and dried bay leaves, are also sometimes used.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the rice in cold water until the water runs clear.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onions and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the red bell peppers and scotch bonnet peppers (if using) and cook for another 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the tomato paste, curry powder, thyme, and salt and cook for 1 minute more.</li>
        <li>Add the tomatoes and stock (if using) to the pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer for 15
        minutes, or until the tomatoes are soft.</li>
        <li>Add the rice to the pot and stir to combine. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and cover. Simmer for 20
        minutes, or until the rice is cooked through.</li>
        <li>Stir in the butter (if using) and serve.
    </ol>
